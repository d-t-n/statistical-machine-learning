# Statistical Machine Learning
 Investigation of data mining and statistical pattern recognition that support artificial intelligence. Main topics covered include supervised learning; unsupervised learning; and deep learning, including major components of machine learning and the data analytics that enable it
 
 ## Distinguish between supervised learning and unsupervised learning

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two major categories of machine learning algorithms, and they differ in terms of the type of input data they work with, the nature of the learning process, and the outcomes they produce.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to map input data to a set of predefined output labels or values, based on a set of labeled examples. In other words, the algorithm is given a set of input-output pairs, called a training dataset, and it learns to generalize from these examples to make predictions on new, unseen data. The goal of supervised learning is to build a model that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen input data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to find patterns and relationships in the input data, without the use of predefined output labels or values. In other words, the algorithm is given a set of input data, called an unlabeled dataset, and it learns to discover the underlying structure and organization of the data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to identify clusters, patterns, or trends in the data that can be used to gain insights or make better decisions. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means clustering), dimensionality reduction algorithms (e.g., principal component analysis), and anomaly detection algorithms.

In summary, supervised learning requires labeled data with known outputs, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. Supervised learning is used for prediction tasks, while unsupervised learning is used for exploratory analysis and data mining.

### Project on Common Probability Distributions in Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to develop a understanding of probability distributions and their application in solving real-world problems using machine learning algorithms.
The project would involve the following steps:

1. Research and identify common probability distributions:
- Gaussian (normal) distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Bernoulli distribution
- etc.


2. Select a machine learning algorithm:
- Classification algorithm (e.g. logistic regression)
- Clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means)


3. Implement the algorithm:
- Load dataset
- Split into training and testing sets
- Train the model using a programming language such as Python


4. Apply probability distributions:
- Calculate probability density function (PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF)
- Use identified probability distributions to model the data


5. Evaluate the performance:
- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of using probability distributions in machine learning applications.


Overall, this project would provide students with an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of probability distributions and their application in machine learning algorithms. It would also allow them to gain hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms and applying probability distributions to real-world datasets.
