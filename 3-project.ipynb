    "In this code, we first load the dataset and perform data preprocessing by dropping rows with missing values, one-hot encoding the categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We then instantiate a Random Forest classifier and fit it on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model by performing 10-fold cross-validation and printing the average score. We then use grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the model, including the number of decision trees, maximum depth, minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. We print the best parameters selected by grid search.\n",
